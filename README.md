## Extra information

The best tool to connect the 12V GND connection is a Wago connector, it creates a common connection. So one GND connection becomes many, it also enables us to safely connect the GND from the 12V PSU to GND connection of the magnetic door lock.

Relays isolate the higher voltage 12V circuit from the low voltage circuit for the Raspberry Pi. This unit cost about Â£3 from eBay.

The RFID reader is an RFID-RC522, you can find them really cheap on eBay but we used the [Monk Make Clever Card Kit](https://www.monkmakes.com/cck/) as it offers a complete kit, along with a great guide. We reviewed it in LXF229, so take a look.
